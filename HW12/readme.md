Direct continuation of week 11, I did waaaay more than I got a little carried away in week 11, so I improved upon week 11's work by modifying it a bit:
I added : 
support for arrow keys as well as the previous wasd, keys.
json w/ 5 obstacle objects to form a sort of 'maze'
collectibles, also in json, giving extra points but aren't randomly generated.
I removed : the color of background changing when a green square was collected.
