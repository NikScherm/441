#Platformer puzzle game
I have decided to do a platformer
I will be building upon the work I did for HW13 where we used phaser.io lib

I cleaned it up by organizing it into scenes and creating objects to use within them
For this first push I have made 2 levels where the player can get to and from by interacting with it with the W or up arrow key


I will be using the assets I made previously
I plan on making it into a puzzle game where the player must push specific objects into certain locations.
I will also incorporate simple minigames within that the player must complete to unlock chests ect..

keybinds are AD or arrow keys for left and right, W for interacting with box space for jump, will make a control page thing in a title screen later on
