#Platformer puzzle game
I have made a small puzzle game with a couple level, using some of the visual assets I came up with for another project (called hallow)
In this game, you spawn in as a little witch and must locate the key by solving very basic puzzles that require you to place pumpkins and move barrels around

I really enjoyed making this, and being able to use these assets

In this project, overcame a few challenges, solving object persistance between seperate scenes with some singleton and OOP programming, through inventoryStore
and PlaceableObjects.
It has taught me just how important it is to make helper functions, refactor, ect... in order to stay organised as you can very quickly get lost

I'm thankful that you introduced us to all these various libraries and I can see myself experimenting more with phaser.js but also
three.js in the future, even though I have not used three.js here.
I will have to restructure the code later on as I now found out that there is a tool for level layout construction called Tiled, which would have
been useful, instead of adding images and objects manually using coordinates instead of visually through a UI.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this small game !

#New keybinds : 
•A-D || <- -> for left right,
•W For interacting with exits
•S to jump down 1 sided platforms
•E to pick up collectibles
