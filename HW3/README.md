## 8. Use ChatGPT, CoPilot or Gemini to recreate the homework assignement. Reflect on its creation. What did you like ? What didn't you like ?

In my case, I used CoPilot:
I copy-pasted questions 1-7 into copilot.

# What I liked :
It gives you a small quick base for the code to tweak as you see fit. It's a bare bones version of the choose your own adventure genre. It would need more personalization. And I'm sure prompting it further would give you that.
So I can see it speeding up the proccess when you don't need to start from scratch.
It always seemed to base its story output on fantasy rather than any other kind of fiction. I thought that was amusing.

# What I didn't like :
The JavaScript it gave was very simple and it seems like if it were to scale (story-wise) we would get lost in it quite quickly
The css was always bare bones. it's expected as I only pasted in the questions.
If you really on it as a base, you could get unoptimal code, or if you rely on it as a base, you aren't to know if that base is a good one for what you are trying to create. If you use other people's work you admire you are more likely to get a better idea of a base you can reliably use further down the line.

## 9. Please include a ReadMe that discusses your successes, challenges, and how you overcame them.
The part that I thought was most challenging was trying not to get lost in the questions and appropriate paths to the story.
I just tried to refactor the text in a way that made it easier to add to it later on. The loops nested if's were confusing.
