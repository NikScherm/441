            <p>I have chosen to go with a bubbly theme for this site as it matches Jeff the Shark. 
                I chose Jeff the Shark from Marvel Rivals because it’s a character I’ve recently had a lot of fun playing. 
                Despite how fun he is to use, many players dislike him because his ultimate ability can wipe out an entire 
                team and win games. I also just think Jeff the Shark is adorable. Marvel Rivals is a competitive FPS, which is 
                typically the type of game I enjoy playing.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am supposed to graduate this semester. My major is Media Arts, and I am currently 27.
            I was born and raised in Colorado, and I am currently attending the University of Montana.
            My main interests are drawing, playing video games, and watching documentaries. I have been 
            drawing my whole life as a hobby and I know a bit of French.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Over time, many elderly individuals experience a decline in brain activity and memory. 
                Games can help these individuals exercise their brains by engaging in gameplay and remembering how to play. 
                Continuing to learn as you age is very important for maintaining mental sharpness and cognitive function, 
                which can worsen with age. We should encourage the elderly to play games. However, I don’t believe the games 
                should be first-person shooters or competitive games like League of Legends, but rather relaxing options such 
                as Animal Crossing or mobile apps like Candy Crush.
