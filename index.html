                <p>I have chosen to go with a bubbly theme for this Site as it matches Jeff the shark.I chose Jeff the Shark from Marvel Rivals because it’s a character I’ve recently
                had a lot of fun playing. Despite how fun he is to use, many players dislike him because his ultimate 
                ability can wipe out an entire team and win games. I also just think Jeff the Shark is
                adorable. Marvel Rivals is a competitive FPS, which is typically the type of game I enjoy playing.</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>Over time, many elderly individuals experience a decline in brain activity and memory. Games can help these individuals 
                    exercise their brains by engaging in game-play and remembering how to play. Continuing to learn as you age is very important 
                    for maintaining mental sharpness and cognitive function, which can worsen with age. We should encourage the elderly to play games.
                     However, I don’t believe the games should be first-person shooters or competitive games like League of Legends, but rather relaxing
                      options such as Animal Crossing or mobile apps like Candy Crush
