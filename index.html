                    <p>I am supposed to graduate this semester, My major is Media Arts and I am currently 27</p>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Colorado, and I am currently attending the University of Montana. I chose Jeff the Shark from Marvel Rivals because it’s a character I’ve recently had a lot of fun playing. Despite how fun he is to use, many players dislike him because his ultimate ability can wipe out an entire team and win games. I also just think Jeff the Shark is adorable. Marvel Rivals is a competitive FPS, which is typically the type of game I enjoy playing.
