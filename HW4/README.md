HW4
Built on, and adding to HW3.

I added user input from textbox in the form of stat allocation, the rest is code from hw3 that I reused and added to/changed. 
What I changed : 
•I replaced the 2 outer if statements with switch statements for better clarity.
•
What I added :
• one more case to increase the story decisions from 0-3 to 0-4, thereby making the story have at least five different decisions in the story.
• more functions that take parameters, and return values.
