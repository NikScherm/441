# 9. Use Generative AI to create a similar piece, please reflect on your experience.
I used Copilot & GPT and what I notice is that it's got a very clean and readible structure. However it sometimes 'forgot' some of the specific requirements like restart option, or it'll use syntax that I have no yet learned in the course and require a lot of effort in order to better understand the overall code, since I would need to first learn of the new syntax by either prompting it with a question about it, & looking it up on w3schools.

As a result I also learned about a few pieces of syntax or functions and find that using these gen ai tools is a quick way of learning about them rather than having to look up that syntax on various website. It isn't infallible however, so looking them up on a website like w3schools can be beneficial for learning when the explination doesn't quite add up to what I'm testing out.
I think the real strength of these gen AI tools comes from utilizing them in small snipets of code to sort of use them as building blocks, as opposed to outsourcing our critical thinking to them, and having them figure out all of what the assignement would require us.
So breaking down a big project into tiny pieces.

I quickly learned about this syntax (...) when trying to reduce clutter & redundancies, it  allows to handle infinite amounts of number of arguments as an array.

# Built on, and added to HW3.
I added user input from textbox in the form of stat allocation, the rest is code from hw3 that I reused and added to/changed. 
What I changed since HW3 : 
-I replaced the 2 outer if statements with switch statements for better clarity.
-functions that get called within the main option() function of the story to improve clarity as much as I can.
What I added, at least all of this weeks HW assignment :
-one more case to increase the story decisions from 0-3 to 0-6, thereby making the story have at least five different decisions in the story.
-more functions that take parameters, and return values to be called from withing the main function to reduce clutter.
-user input for stat allocation in form of text. I left the story with button allocation because I think it looks and feels better to play that way. Me adding the text at the start for stat allocation is to prove that the work was done and that I'm capable of doing it.
-added for loop, inside of getbuttons function. 
-changing styling & images from withing script.js
-restart option also takes typed user input.
